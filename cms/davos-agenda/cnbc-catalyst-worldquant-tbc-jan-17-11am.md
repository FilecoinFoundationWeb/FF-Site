f_description: CNBC Catalyst, the commercial arm of CNBC, in partnership with
  WorldQuant University. As AI fundamentally reshapes the world, how do we
  provide training and skills development to equip the workforce to participate
  in a new era of the economy? It is critical that we re-evaluate the ties
  between education and business through the lens of AI and advanced
  technologies to address the prevailing gaps in both skill and opportunity.
  What does the future of the workplace look like – and how do we ensure the
  workforce is equipped with the right skills to succeed? From reskilling and
  upskilling to reforms in our education systems – education leaders will
  discuss the business and societal imperative of skills-based education, and
  how we can leverage technology to broaden access to quality education to
  students globally.
