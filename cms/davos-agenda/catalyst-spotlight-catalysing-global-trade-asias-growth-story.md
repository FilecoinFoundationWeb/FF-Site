f_description: Programmed by CNBC Catalyst, the commercial arm of CNBC, in
  partnership with Standard Chartered | Fueled by shifts in global supply chains
  and a growing digital economy, Asia continues to stand as a growth anchor for
  the world, amid persistent uncertainties such as inflation, soaring interest
  rates, and political headwinds.  A connector for finance, technology and
  innovation, Asia has taken an influential and transformative role in shaping
  global trade dynamics. As the region continues to grow in scale and navigate
  the trade landscape, what will it take to bridge the East-West gap and
  continue leveraging opportunities to foster equitable and sustainable growth?
