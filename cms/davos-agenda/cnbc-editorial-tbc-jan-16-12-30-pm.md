f_description: The worldâ€™s population has doubled in just 40 years to more than
  8 billion and is forecast to rise another 2 billion in the next 30. Today, 250
  million people face acute hunger or starvation, according to the Food Security
  Information Network. But as the population grows, food supplies are threatened
  and prices are rising as climate and conflicts ravage communities and
  agriculture. This panel explores these challenges, discusses the innovative
  solutions and analyses what else needs to happen to make basic nutrition
  sustainable for everyone.
