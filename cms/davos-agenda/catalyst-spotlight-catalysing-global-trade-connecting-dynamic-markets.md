f_description: Programmed by CNBC Catalyst, the commercial arm of CNBC, in
  partnership with Standard Chartered. Globalisation has delivered economic
  growth and lifted living standards for millions. However, some developing
  markets and smaller businesses have been left in its wake and are struggling
  to keep pace with the benefits enjoyed by larger economies.   How can we
  enable the participation of smaller markets and businesses to ensure a fairer,
  more inclusive, and sustainable future? As global trade continues to power
  prosperity, how can the public and private sectors do better to connect
  capital to where itâ€™s needed most?
f_speakers: Simon Cooper, CEO, Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking and
  CEO, Europe & Americas, Standard Chartered
