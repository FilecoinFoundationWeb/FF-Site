f_description: Almost 2 years on since Russian troops invaded Ukraine, the war
  rages on. President Zelenskyy has voiced his fears that the conflict in the
  Middle East has overshadowed what is going on within his country, and implored
  the international community to remain committed to protecting Ukraine. But the
  war has caused diplomatic tensions from Brussels to Washington, with Ukraineâ€™s
  accession a key issue for European leaders, and aid to Ukraine becoming a
  political football in Congress. We try to answer the tough questions on where
  the conflict is heading, and how the Ukraine economy can rebuild after the
  invasion in 2022.
