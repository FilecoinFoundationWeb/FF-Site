f_description: 2024 is expected to see over 70 countries worldwide hold general
  elections, with some of the most consequential taking place in the European
  Union, Taiwan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. The outcome of
  these elections will influence, and be influenced, by factors beyond the
  borders of the countries themselves and nowhere is this more the case than in
  America. In this session, we will explore why certain elections will be
  crucial and what their outcomes will mean for the global economy.
