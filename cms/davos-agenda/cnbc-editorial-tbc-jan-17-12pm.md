f_description: Programmed by CNBC Catalyst, the commercial arm of CNBC, in
  partnership with Standard Chartered | Central to global trade dynamics, major
  trade hubs serve as the key nodes, driving greater connectivity and boosting
  both intra-regional and global trade. Leveraging their strategic locations,
  regional hubs within the Middle East play a pivotal role in linking Europe,
  Asia, and Africa, presenting opportunities to facilitate global trade and
  advance cutting-edge industrialization.     How can hubs like the UAE deepen
  trade and investment ties with fast-growing economies? And how can
  inter-connectivity between the Middle East and Africa promote innovation and
  drive inclusive and sustainable growth?
