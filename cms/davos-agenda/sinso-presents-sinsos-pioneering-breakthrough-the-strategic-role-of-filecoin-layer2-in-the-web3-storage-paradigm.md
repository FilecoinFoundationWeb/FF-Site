f_description: "Let's dive into the wild world of data. We're all data-making
  machines. 90% percent of the world’s data was created in the last two years.
  And every two years, the volume of data across the world doubles in size.
  SINSO’s Brian Lao explores how to efficiently store the world’s most important
  data using decentralized tools. "
