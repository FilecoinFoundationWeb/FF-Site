f_description: COP 28 climate summit reached a historic deal to transition away
  from fossil fuels but did the agreement go far enough? According to the IEA’s
  World Energy Outlook for 2023, countries must do more to limit global warming
  to 1.5 degrees Celsius as demand for oil, coal and natural gas is set to peak
  by the end of the decade. This panel looks at how countries can diversify
  energy supplies while maintaining economic stability.
