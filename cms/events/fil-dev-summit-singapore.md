f_description: FIL Dev Summit is a gathering of developers, builders, and
  engaged community members who want to contribute to the core protocol and
  network evolution of Filecoin (think IPFS Thing, but bigger!). This summit is
  more than just a meetupâ€”it's a place for meaningful and impactful
  conversations that help push Filecoin forward.  Discussions at the summit will
  cover a wide range of topics, from protocol scalability and network
  improvements to the intricacies of data onboarding and governance
  structures.These conversations serve to share and refine improvements - where
  participants can gain insights from diverse perspectives, challenge
  assumptions, and collectively arrive at innovative solutions to the challenges
  faced by the Filecoin ecosystem.
