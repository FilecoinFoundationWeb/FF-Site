f_preview-text: Reversing deforestation and climate change through blockchain tech
f_description: The built-in immutability that comes with storing data on
  Filecoin is extremely beneficial for groups like GainForest, a non-profit
  organization focused on reversing deforestation and climate change through
  blockchain tech. GainForest founder David Dao states, “Nature-based solutions
  need to be permanent and transparent for stakeholders. That is why it is so
  crucial that the data…must be permanent and transparent as well. Decentralized
  data storage guarantees just that. At any point in time, anyone everywhere in
  the world can look up, reproduce, and audit our analysis. Low-quality projects
  can’t hide anymore in static PDFs.”
