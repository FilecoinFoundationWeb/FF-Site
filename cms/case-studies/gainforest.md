f_preview-text: Reversing deforestation and climate change through blockchain tech
f_description: >-
  The built-in immutability that comes with storing data on Filecoin is
  extremely beneficial for groups like GainForest, a non-profit organization
  focused on reversing deforestation and climate change through blockchain tech.
  GainForest founder David Dao states, “Nature-based solutions need to be
  permanent and transparent for stakeholders. That is why it is so crucial that
  the data…must be permanent and transparent as well. Decentralized data storage
  guarantees just that. At any point in time, anyone everywhere in the world can
  look up, reproduce, and audit our analysis. Low-quality projects can’t hide
  anymore in static PDFs.”
