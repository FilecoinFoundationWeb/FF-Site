Filecoin Plus (Fil+) is a layer of social trust to incentivize the storage of real data on the Filecoin network. Since its inception, Filecoin Plus has brought 1.8 EiB of verified deals to the network. 

In 2023, the program took major strides in its goals to incentivize data onboarding through deploying new bots supporting functions ranging from retrieval to compliance. Now, as part of the program's efforts to refine the program, Fil+ has transitioned to a new allocator model: another step towards incentivizing data onboarding across use cases with [community-governed trust mechanisms](https://fil.org/blog/announcing-the-quality-phase-for-filecoin-plus-aligning-on-the-filecoin-plus-vision-mission-statement-and-roadmap/) that rely on quality, transparency, and enablement. 

## Allocator Selection 

The [revamped V5 election cycle](https://fil.org/blog/what%E2%80%99s-new-with-the-filecoin-plus-notary-election-and-filecoin-day-highlights-from-labweek23/), zeroing in on Allocator (formerly Notary) pathways, concluded on February 6, 2024 with the selection of the latest round of allocators. 

The new model empowers every Filecoin community member an opportunity to design and run their unique DataCap allocator mechanism if there is not one available to meet their needs.

As a result, many allocators are running new pathways, and developing a versatile, meta-level program for the creation and operation of various allocator mechanisms for distributing DataCap.

## What are Allocators?

Allocators act as fiduciaries for the Filecoin network and are trusted to responsibly allocate DataCap to help foster legitimate use cases.

Clients looking to onboard valuable data onto the network apply to Allocators to receive DataCap. Data clients then use DataCap to make deals with storage providers, who are incentivized to store this verified data as it increases their share of block rewards over time.

To accomplish onboarding, pathways fall into one of three categories:

* Manual Diligence Allocator: Pathways involving human intervention, ensuring a meticulous inspection and onboarding of the data aligned with the Allocator's goals. As of 2024, the majority of allocators are manual. 
* Market-Based Allocator: Pathways operating on different ideas, such as auction [houses,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLR6nZ8ic4ARj3J46XsxSE_b1RpDP_z3JBKL4alHGGw/edit) Trustless [Notary,](https://github.com/filecoin-project/notary-governance/discussions/888) etc.
* Automated Allocator: Pathways leveraging automated processes, such as GLIF’s GitHub O-Auth.

What’s ahead 

Introducing new pathways prepares the network to handle a vast number of clients and diverse use cases, as well as reinforcing the commitment to scaling with future network demands. Expanding pathways from a one-size-fits-all approach ensures data clients from varied regions, industries, and objectives can now benefit from pathways that resonate with their specific needs. 

We look forward to onboarding this round, and plan to implement rolling applications in Q2 2024. If you are interested in becoming an allocator, we encourage you to apply!
