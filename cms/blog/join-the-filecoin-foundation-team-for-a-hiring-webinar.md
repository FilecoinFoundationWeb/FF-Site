The Filecoin Foundation is part of the community building the next generation of the web. Our mission is to develop, enrich, support, and grow both the Filecoin and Web3 ecosystems. We want to cultivate and create value for everyone involved in building the decentralized future of the web.

That’s why we’re excited to expand our team. We’re hiring [Developer Evangelists](https://jobs.lever.co/filecoin/3c3abe18-0d92-440a-a1c4-99612b00f429), [Program Managers](https://jobs.lever.co/filecoin/19a2631c-9102-412f-b186-304a8b677d50), and [Startup Operators](https://jobs.lever.co/filecoin/4a07b3ba-f3c2-4fd3-bc88-57f4da030b77). If you’re interested in the work we’re doing at the Filecoin Foundation and you’re curious about joining our team, we invite you to participate in a webinar with the Foundation team on Thursday, February 18, at 1:00 pm PT. We’ll walk through the mission and operational structure of the Foundation and answer your questions on our open job positions and our organizational culture. [Register for the webinar](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_OqIIdEIvRL26RNwJ03prBw).

With decentralized technologies and protocols like Filecoin, we can build a more efficient, more robust, and more secure foundation for humanity’s information. We hope you’ll join us in our journey to make Web3 a reality.
