Vegas was humming with the sound of hundreds of excited Filecoin ecosystem participants gathering under one roof to discuss decentralized storage in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Let’s dive into some highlights from FIL Vegas.

This marquee event brought together Storage Providers with ecosystem enablers, AI experts, and capital providers. The resulting collaborations were transformational, seeding the ground to usher in a new internet infrastructure. 

## So…..What Happened in Vegas?

AI and data verifiability were the thematic pegs for FIL Vegas. Why AI? As Chris Hackney of AI Guardian said, growth of the amount of data related to AI will be incomprehensible, accelerating faster than anyone can forecast. 

As AI becomes more regulated, companies may be required to save and prove integrity of the datasets underlying their AI models. Decentralized storage provides a more equitable and reliable solution for the massive datasets that are the backbone of these networks, offering unparalleled resilience, scale, and cost savings.

Our three AI keynotes, [Scale AI’s Vijay Karunamurthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPh4sxBfk_E), [AI Guardian’s Chris Hackney,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDJkwH-EjVU&list=PLp3zrT1ewY0l6mwL6ymdwHapRHmSbbVAO&index=2&t=25s) and AMD’s Jörg Roskowetz illustrated the emerging trends and challenges for AI innovation and set the stage for how Filecoin will play a major role in AI’s radical growth.

Hearing from the investor community renewed enthusiasm and a sense of purpose for the network. Keynotes from Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital and Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, energized the community and raised new possibilities for the growth and success of the ecosystem. 

Mark Yusko summed it up: "The people here are the ones with incredible conviction and incredible passion, and I had some of the best conversations I've had in a long time. These are people building real tech with real solutions.”

## Beyond the Main Stage

* ESPA: This was the largest ESPA event in the accelerator’s two year history with over 100 attendees, 62 organizations from 17 different countries, and 70 workshops held during the week.  
* Decentralized Storage Alliance (DSA): The first ever event to bring together all 16 DSA organizations, including AMD, EY, and Seagate, together to discuss the future of decentralized storage. 
* DeStor: Hosted 23 workshops and five mainstage presentations all dedicated to guiding the community towards more storage opportunities.

## Takeaways from Las Vegas

FIL Vegas evolved into a space for newcomers and veterans in the ecosystem to find their conviction in the future and to begin building towards it. Legacy Filecoiners, such as Holon, Seal Storage, Internet Archive, USC Libraries, and web3mine, all worked with newer community members on partnerships, roadmaps, and architectures. While newer participants such as Steeldome, EY, Intel, Zenlayer, and Telarus got to see the potential of Filecoin and the dedication of its community first hand  –– each leaving with a set of action items to progress their involvement.
