Vegas was humming with the sound of hundreds of excited Filecoin ecosystem participants gathering under one roof to discuss decentralized storage in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Let’s dive into some highlights from FIL Vegas.

This marquee event brought together Storage Providers with ecosystem enablers, AI experts, and capital providers. The resulting collaborations were transformational, seeding the ground to  usher in a new internet infrastructure. 

## So…..What Happened in Vegas?

AI and data verifiability were the thematic pegs for FIL Vegas. Why AI? As Chris Hackney of AI Guardian said, growth of the amount of data related to AI will be incomprehensible, accelerating faster than anyone can forecast. 

As AI becomes more regulated, companies may be required to save and prove integrity of the datasets underlying their AI models. Decentralized storage provides a more equitable and reliable solution for the massive datasets that are the backbone of these networks, offering unparalleled resilience, scale, and cost savings.

Our three AI keynotes, [Scale AI’s Vijay Karunamurthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPh4sxBfk_E), [AI Guardian’s Chris Hackney,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDJkwH-EjVU&list=PLp3zrT1ewY0l6mwL6ymdwHapRHmSbbVAO&index=2&t=25s) and AMD’s Jörg Roskowetz illustrated the emerging trends and challenges for AI innovation and set the stage for how Filecoin will play a major role in AI’s radical growth.

Hearing from the investor community renewed enthusiasm and a sense of purpose for the network. Keynotes from Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital and Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, energized the community and raised new possibilities for the growth and success of the ecosystem. 

Mark Yusko summed it up: "The people here are the ones with incredible conviction and incredible passion, and I had some of the best conversations I've had in a long time. These are people building real tech with real solutions.”
