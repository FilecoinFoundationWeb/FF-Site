Filecoin Station is a desktop app that securely connects your computer's idle resources, such as storage, compute, or bandwidth, to the Filecoin network by completing jobs on behalf of the network. Users are rewarded based on the total number of job completions like testing Filecoin Storage Providers from the edge of the network. Filecoin Stationâ€™s mission is to allow anyone to easily join the Web3 economy.
