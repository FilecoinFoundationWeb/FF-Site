Fission builds open source protocols and managed services that empower developers to construct scalable and secure software applications focused on identity, data, and compute solutions. This includes long-term maintenance and support of core open-source tools like FilSnap, a MetaMask plugin, adding support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality.
