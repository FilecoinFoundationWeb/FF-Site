Portrait is an open-source web page builder that lets you turn your blockchain address into a website. Portrait web pages are automatically pinned to IPFS and stored on Filecoin, making the sites secure and resilient by design. Portrait’s goal is to enable communities to develop creative work in a decentralized way –– from custom blogs for writers, to online portfolios for designers, to landing pages for podcasts hosts.
