f_bio: Karl Friston is a theoretical neuroscientist and authority on brain
  imaging. He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based
  morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM). These contributions were
  motivated by schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of value-learning,
  formulated as the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia.   Mathematical
  contributions include variational Laplacian procedures and generalized
  filtering for hierarchical Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works
  on models of functional integration in the human brain and the principles that
  underlie neuronal interactions. His main contribution to theoretical
  neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception (active
  inference).   Friston received the first Young Investigators Award in Human
  Brain Mapping (1996) and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical
  Sciences (1999). In 2000 he was President of the international Organization of
  Human Brain Mapping. In 2003 he was awarded the Minerva Golden Brain Award and
  was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006. In 2008 he received a
  Medal, College de France and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of York
  in 2011. He became of Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology in 2012, received
  the Weldon Memorial prize and Medal in 2013 for contributions to mathematical
  biology and was elected as a member of EMBO (excellence in the life sciences)
  in 2014 and the Academia Europaea in (2015). He was the 2016 recipient of the
  Charles Branch Award for unparalleled breakthroughs in Brain Research and the
  Glass Brain Award - a lifetime achievement award in the field of human brain
  mapping. He holds Honorary Doctorates from the University of Zurich and
  Radboud University.
