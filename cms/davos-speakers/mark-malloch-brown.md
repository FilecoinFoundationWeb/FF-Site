f_bio: "Mark Malloch-Brown is president of the Open Society Foundations, the
  world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice,
  democratic governance, and human rights.  He has worked to advance human
  rights, justice, and development for more than four decades in a variety of
  roles: with the United Nations, the World Bank, and as a British government
  minister, as well as with a range of civil society groups and business.  At
  the United Nations, Malloch-Brown spearheaded the global promotion of the UN
  Millennium Development Goals as head of the United Nations Development
  Programme (UNDP) from 1999 to 2005, under the then UN Secretary General, Kofi
  Annan. At the UNDP, and previously as head of external affairs at the World
  Bank, Malloch-Brown led reform efforts that were widely seen as increasing the
  impact of both organizations.  He later served as Kofi Annan’s chief of staff,
  and then as UN Deputy Secretary General, before joining the British government
  of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, as minister responsible for Africa and Asia
  from 2007 to 2009.  Malloch-Brown rejoined Open Society’s Global Board in
  2009, reflecting a close friendship with George Soros that developed in the
  early 1990s when he was working as a political consultant in Latin America and
  later over relief efforts in Bosnia. In 1995, Soros backed Malloch-Brown and
  others’ idea of launching the International Crisis Group, an NGO focused on
  preventing and averting violent conflict, in response to the horrors seen in
  Rwanda, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia.  More recently, he chaired Best
  for Britain, a group that makes the case for Britain’s engagement with the
  European Union, and has among others led the boards of the Royal Africa
  Society, the UN Foundation, and the Business Commission for Sustainable
  Development.  Malloch-Brown was knighted for his contribution to international
  affairs and is currently on leave from the British House of Lords.
  Malloch-Brown is a Distinguished Practitioner at Oxford University’s Blavatnik
  School of Government, an adjunct fellow at Chatham House’s Queen Elizabeth
  Program, and has been a visiting distinguished fellow at the Yale Center for
  the Study of Globalization."
