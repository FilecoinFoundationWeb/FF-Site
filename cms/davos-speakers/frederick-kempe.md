f_bio: "Fred Kempe is the president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic
  Council. Under his leadership since 2007, the Council has achieved historic,
  industry-leading growth in size and influence, expanding its work through
  regional centers spanning the globe and through centers focused on topics
  ranging from international security and energy to global trade and next
  generation mentorship.  Before joining the Council, Kempe was a prize-winning
  editor and reporter at the Wall Street Journal for more than twenty-five
  years. In New York, he served as assistant managing editor, International, and
  columnist. Prior to that, he was the longest-serving editor and associate
  publisher ever of the Wall Street Journal Europe, running the global Wall
  Street Journal’s editorial operations in Europe and the Middle East.  In 2002,
  The European Voice, a leading publication following EU affairs, selected Kempe
  as one of the fifty most influential Europeans, and as one of the four leading
  journalists in Europe. At the Wall Street Journal, he served as a roving
  correspondent based out of London; as a Vienna Bureau chief covering Eastern
  Europe and East-West Affairs; as chief diplomatic correspondent in Washington,
  DC; and as the paper’s first Berlin Bureau chief following the unification of
  Germany and collapse of the Soviet Union.  As a reporter, he covered events
  including the rise of Solidarity in Poland and the growing Eastern European
  resistance to Soviet rule; the coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia
  and his summit meetings with President Ronald Reagan; the wars in Afghanistan,
  Iraq, and Lebanon in the 1980s; and the American invasion of Panama. He also
  covered the unification of Germany and the collapse of Soviet Communism.  He
  is the author of four books. The most recent, Berlin 1961: Kennedy,
  Khrushchev, and the Most Dangerous Place on Earth, was a New York Times Best
  Seller and a National Best Seller. Published in 2011, it has subsequently been
  translated into thirteen different languages.  Kempe is a graduate of the
  University of Utah and has a master’s degree from Columbia University’s
  Graduate School of Journalism, where he was a member of the International
  Fellows program in the School of International Affairs. He won the Columbia
  Graduate School of Journalism’s top alumni achievement award and the
  University of Utah’s Distinguished Alumnus Award. He is a member of the
  Council on Foreign Relations and Gender Champions in Nuclear Policy.  For his
  commitment to strengthening the transatlantic alliance, Kempe has been
  decorated by the Presidents of Poland and Germany and by King Carl XVI Gustaf
  of Sweden."
