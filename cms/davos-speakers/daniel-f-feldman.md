  practices.  Drawing on his prior positions in government service spanning
  multiple Administrations, former Ambassador Dan Feldman’s practice focuses on
  environmental, social, and governance (ESG) counseling, business and human
  rights (BHR), global public policy, as well as broader international

  initiative.  As Chief of Staff and Counselor to Secretary John Kerry when he
  was appointed the first Special Presidential Envoy for Climate (SPEC) by
  President Biden, Dan helped drive the U.S. government’s international climate
  agenda, coordinating high level interagency policy-making, engaging with

  Democratic presidential and Congressional campaigns.  Dan has extensive
  experience counseling multinational corporations on mitigating risk and
  maximizing opportunities in the development and implementation of their ESG
  and sustainability strategies, with a particular background in advising on BHR
  matters. He was one of the first attorneys in the U.S. to develop a practice
  in corporate social responsibility, and has been cited by Chambers for his BHR
  expertise. He assists clients in strategizing about their engagements with a
  range of key stakeholders, including Members of Congress, executive branch
  officials, foreign government officials and Embassy representatives,
