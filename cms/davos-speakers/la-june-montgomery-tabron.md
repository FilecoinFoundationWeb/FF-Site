  Foundation (WKKF) in Battle Creek, Michigan, one of the largest private
  foundations in the United States. As president and CEO, Tabron leads the
  Kellogg Foundation in its work to support thriving children, working families
  and equitable communities.  Prior to becoming the first African American
  president and CEO to lead the foundation in its history, she served in a
  variety of positions at the Kellogg Foundation after joining the organization
  as the controller in 1987. Most recently, she was the executive vice president
  of operations and treasurer, which included oversight of all financial plans,
  policies and relationships within the financial community and WKKF’s
  Technology, Human Resources and Administration, Finance, Program Services and
  Quality & Organizational Effectiveness functions. In this role, she was
  pivotal in connecting and integrating WKKF’s leadership committees: the
  Executive Council, Program Leadership Council, Talent Board and Organizational
  Advisory Team, ensuring unified execution of the organization’s mission and
  strategic framework across all programmatic and priority place areas. She also
  provided leadership for WKKF’s place-based grantmaking in Mississippi and New
  Orleans since 2011, launching a significant effort to help set young males of
  color on the path to success in 2013.  Tabron has played an active leadership
  role in the Kellogg Foundation’s racial equity, diversity and inclusion work
  for more than two decades – both internally through work with its board and
  staff, and externally through its work with grantees, partners and
  vendors.  Other earlier positions at WKKF included: chief operating officer
  and treasurer; senior vice president/chief financial officer and treasurer;
  vice president – finance and treasurer; and assistant vice president for
  finance and assistant treasurer. Prior to joining WKKF, she was an auditor for
  Plante & Moran CPAs.  Throughout her more than 30 years in philanthropy,
  Tabron has participated in numerous sector efforts to enhance philanthropy,
  including: the policy and annual conference committees for the Council on
  Foundations and the board development and transparency committees for
  Independent Sector.  As a community and civic leader, Tabron is a member of
  the Kalamazoo Chapter of the Links, Incorporated. She also serves on the
  boards of Battle Creek Community Health Partners, Bronson Healthcare Group,
  Kellogg Company, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), and the
  Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America-College Retirement
  Equities Fund (TIAA). Tabron is also the chair of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation
  Trust.  Tabron holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the
  University of Michigan – Ann Arbor and a master’s degree in business
  administration from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern
  University. She received honorary doctorates from Elms College, Grand Valley
  State University, Ithaca College, Marygrove College and Union Institute &
  University. She is a certified public accountant. She is also a graduate of
  the inaugural class of the Council on Foundations’ Career Pathways Program. In
  2020, Tabron was named the recipient of the Bynum Tudor Fellowship at Kellogg
  College in Oxford, England. The Joint Center for Political and Economic
  Studies awarded Tabron the Louis E. Martin Great American Award, the
  organization’s highest honor, in 2022.  The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF),
  founded in 1930 as an independent, private foundation by breakfast cereal
  innovator and entrepreneur Will Keith Kellogg, is among the largest
  philanthropic foundations in the United States. Guided by the belief that all
  children should have an equal opportunity to thrive, WKKF works with
  communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize
  their full potential in school, work and life.  The Kellogg Foundation is
  based in Battle Creek, Michigan, and works throughout the United States and
  internationally, as well as with sovereign tribes. Special attention is paid
  to priority places where there are high concentrations of poverty and where
  children face significant barriers to success. WKKF priority places in the
  U.S. are in Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico and New Orleans; and
  internationally, are in Mexico and Haiti. For more information, visit
