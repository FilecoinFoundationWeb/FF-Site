f_bio: Eric Usher Heads the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative, UNEP
  FI, a global partnership bringing together the UN with a global group of
  banks, insurers and asset managers working to develop the sustainable finance
  and responsible investment agendas. Eric oversees governance, strategy and
  day-to-day management of UNEP FIâ€™s work programme and global network
  development. Over the years UNEP FI has established some of the most important
  sustainability oriented frameworks within the finance industry, including the
  Principles for Responsible Investment (2006), the Principles for Sustainable
  Insurance (2012) and the Principles for Responsible Banking (2019). Since
  joining in 2015, Mr. Usher has focused on accelerating the deep integration of
  sustainability risks into financial practice, including addressing climate
  change, natural capital loss and human rights abuses, as well as building out
  the frameworks for positive impact finance needed to achieve the UN
  Sustainable Development Goals. Eric sits on several industry bodies including
  as UN representative on the Board of the Principles for Responsible
  Investment, and as a member of the governing boards of the Sustainable Stock
  Exchanges Initiative, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, the Investor Agenda
  and the impact fund REPP Africa.  Prior to leading UNEP FI, Mr. Usher has over
  twenty years of experience in the low carbon sectors, spanning technology
  commercialisation in Canada, solar rural electrification in Morocco and
  financial sector development across emerging markets. During 2011, Mr. Usher
  worked on the establishment of the Green Climate Fund and led efforts to
  create its Private Sector Facility. Eric has been an editor of the Global
  Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report published annually with Bloomberg
  and was lead author for finance of the IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy
  Sources. Earlier in his career, Eric was General Manager of a solar rural
  electrification company based in Morocco.
