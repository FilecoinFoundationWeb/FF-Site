It leverages [NetlifyCMS](https://decapcms.org/) as a Git-based CMS to enable contributors to edit dynamic content without the need for knowledge of Git or Markdown. The final site is published to [Fleek](https://fleek.co/), allowing it to be hosted on the Filecoin network and accessed via [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).
